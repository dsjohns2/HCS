Bugs to Fix:
-fix paths to matlab function call

Ideas to Implement:
-progress bar through steps
-auto generate pressure graph
-disable continue buttons in steps when condition is not met (like pressure is not low enough)
-data to write: when systems bools are on and off
-auto continue after wait if fp read looks good (i.e. if pressure is low enough)
-condense checking steps (compressed air is already displayed and is then checked in a step)
-give synopsis of experiment at end (pressure data chart, ...)
-open vacuum plot picture, not the plot in matlab (could be quicker?)

Completed:
-keep record of pressure
-make continuously running while loop record the pressure (and other?) data
-rename vis with underscores
